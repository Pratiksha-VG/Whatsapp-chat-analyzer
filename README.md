The project is a WhatsApp chat analyzer built using Streamlit, where users can upload their chat history file to visualize various statistics and insights such as total messages, word count, media shared, links shared, monthly and daily activity timelines, activity maps, word clouds, most common words, emoji analysis, and more. It preprocesses the chat data, extracts relevant information like user names, messages, dates, and then generates interactive visualizations and summaries for deeper insights into the chat behavior and trends.
